/* 
 *  So basically this part of the code will read a string from the the serial monitor, which will be our user input for now, and output each character of the string individually
 *  We will later connect this with the Morse alphabet functions to produce a "text to Morse buzzer" translator
 *  
 *  As I'm working on this, I've realized for convience that input messages will need to be made lower case and all non-alphanumeric characters (except periods) will need to be excluded
 *  Should be simple enough. I'm planning on having an if statement for every input (probably inefficient, if you have a better suggestion let me know) and all non-morse compatable characters just won't have a behavior associated with them
